**A Day in the Life of Velma**

* 9 am: Mom wakes up. I ask her to tuck me back in before she leaves so I can have the warm spot.
* 10:30 am: Dad is up now, so I run out to the kitchen looking for someone to share their breakfast with me. I get kibble, not my favorite but I eat it in 30 seconds anyways.
* 11 am: Despite my best efforts to stay on the couch, someone inevitably takes me for a _walk_. Can you believe it? I _hate_ walks!
* 12-4 pm: One long nap. I need it after my waddle around the block this morning.
* 5 pm: Food amp&; head scratches.
